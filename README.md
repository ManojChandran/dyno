# Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service that supports key-value and document data structures and is offered by Amazon.com as part of the Amazon Web Services portfolio.

# AWS SDK for Go

aws-sdk-go is the official AWS SDK for the Go programming language.

# Environment Variables for SDK

By default, the SDK detects AWS credentials set in your environment and uses them to sign requests to AWS. That way you don't need to manage credentials in your applications. The SDK looks for credentials in the following environment variables:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY /AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)

The following examples show how you configure the environment variables.

Linux, OS X, or Unix

$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AKID <br />
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY <br />
$ export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=TOKEN <br />
$ export AWS_REGION=us-east-1 <br />

Windows

C:\> set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AKID <br />
C:\> set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY <br />
C:\> set AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=TOKEN <br />
C:\> set AWS_REGION=us-east-1 <br />
